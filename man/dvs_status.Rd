gives the statuses of previously added files (\code{up-to-date}, \code{out-of-sync}, or \code{not-present})
to make users aware if files stored in the storage directory don't exist in their local repository or have been updated.
If no file paths or glob patterns are inputted, \code{dvs_status} gives the status of all previously added files.
