\title{get or update files if they are in shared storage to add to the local repo}
\usage{
dvs_get(files, split_output = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{file paths or glob patterns to get from the storage directory}

\item{split_output}{when split_output is true, a list of two data frames -
\code{successes} and \code{failures} - is returned.
Rows in \code{successes} are files successfully retrieved, and rows in \code{failures}
are inputs that returned errors.
When split_output is false, the output is a single data frame with all files
attempted to recopy to the project directory,
and whose success or failure is indicated as such in the outcome column.}
}
\value{
one or two data frames whose rows are the files attempted to get in the given operation.
}
\description{
get or update files if they are in shared storage to add to the local repo
}
\details{
retrieves files previously added with \link{dvs_add} to the storage
directory (initialized by \link{dvs_init}).
If a file is explicitly inputted without a corresponding dvs metadata file i.e.
hasn't been added yet with \link{dvs_add}, the command returns an error.

For any other error retrieving a particular file, the function itself will
indicate the error type and message in the data frame output; the function
itself will not return an error.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# would get all previously added files in data/derived from
# the initialized storage directory
dvs_get("data/derived/*.dvs")

# would get all files in data/derived (excluding
# .gitignore files) and ~Projects/project_x/large_file.pdf
# from the initialized storage directory
dvs_get(c("data/derived/*", "~Projects/project_x/large_file.pdf"))
}
