\description{
copy files to the storage directory
}
\details{
after initializing the storage directory with \link{dvs_init}, this command
copies files to storage directory for other collaborators to version and retrieve with \link{dvs_get}
If an explicitly inputted file doesn't exist, the command returns an error .

For any other error retrieving a particular file, the function itself will
indicate the error type and message in the data frame output; the function
itself will not return an error.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# would add all csv files in data/derived to the initialized storage directory
dvs_add("data/derived/*.csv")

# would add model/nonmem/1001/1001.ext and all files in data/derived
# to the initialized storage directory (excluding dvs metadata and .gitignore files)
dvs_add(c("model/nonmem/1001/1001.ext", "data/derived/*"))
