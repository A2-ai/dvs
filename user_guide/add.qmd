## Adding to Devious

Executing this command for a given file is necessary to retrieve it later. This command copies files to a storage directory from which they can be retrieved later.

#### R Command

```{r}
dvs_add(files = c("path/to/file1", "path/to/file2"), message = "assembled data sets for project X")
```

-   `files` is a vector of file glob characters representing the set of files to be copied to the initialized storage_directory

-   `message` is a character that gives a contextualizing message for future file retrievers

-   the output is a data frame whose rows are the added files and the columns for a given file are its:

    -   `path`: relative to the git directory
    -   `hash`: from blake3 (if successfully created)
    -   `outcome` of adding (`Success`, `Error`, or `Already Present`)
    -   `error` summary if the `outcome` was `Error`
    -   `size`

#### Shell Command

```         
dvs init path/to/file1 path/to/file2 --message="assembled data sets for project X"
```

(TODO: implement) (TODO: check if quotes are needed for message)

-   the first argument is a space separated list in the CLI containing file globs representing the set of files to be copied to the initialized storage_directory

-   `message` is a contextualizing message for future file retrievers
