### Adding to Devious

Executing this command is the essential prerequisite to retrieving files later. This command copies files to a storage directory from which they can be retrieved later.

In R, this command may look like:

```{r}
dvs_add(files = c("path/to/file1", "path/to/file2"), message = "assembled data sets for project X")
```

-   `files` is a vector of characters containing file globs representing the set of files to be copied to the initialized storage_directory

-   `message` is a character that gives a contextualizing message for future file retrievers

-   the output is a dataframe whose rows are each added file and columns are 


In Shell, this command may look like: (TODO: implement) (TODO: check if quotes are needed for message)

```         
dvs init path/to/file1 path/to/file2 --message="assembled data sets for project X"
```

-   the first argument is a space separated list in the CLI containing file globs representing the set of files to be copied to the initialized storage_directory

-   `message` is a contextualizing message for future file retrievers
