Devious is a file linker that allows you to version files under Git without directly tracking them.

Instead of uploading to Git, Devious has Git track a metadata file containing a reference to the file stored in an accessible location. This tool is a solution for teams who wish to collaborate without uploading large or sensitive files to Git.

### High-level Workflows

For a user who makes files accessible:

-   initialize devious in a given project directory, which sets:

    -   the storage directory from which files are retrieved
    -   the file permissions (optionally)
    -   the file group ownership (optionally)

-   add files

    - this will create a copy of each file in the initialized storage directory

    - create a contextualizing message (optionally)

-   update previously added files by just re-adding

-   push to Git 

    -   this will add the configuration and metadata files automatically generated by Devious to Git, but not the files themselves


For a user who accesses files:

-   pull from Git

-   check the status of devious - this will list all previously added files 

-   get all absent files
