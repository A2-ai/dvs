Devious is a file linker that allows you to version files under Git without directly tracking them.

Instead of uploading to Git, Devious has Git track a metadata file containing a reference to the file stored in an accessible location. This tool is a solution for teams who wish to collaborate without uploading large or sensitive files to Git.

### High-level Workflows

For a user who makes files accessible:

1.  initialize devious in a Git repository, which sets:

    -   the storage directory from which files are retrieved (outside of the git repo)
    -   the file permissions (optional)
    -   the file group ownership (optional)

2.  add files

    -   this will create a copy of each file in the initialized storage directory

    -   create a contextualizing message for those who will access these files later (optional)

    -   update previously added files by just re-adding

3.  push to Git

    -   this will add the configuration and metadata files automatically generated by Devious to Git, but not the files themselves

For a user who accesses files:

1.  pull from Git

2.  check the status of devious

    -   this will list all previously added files and whether they are present, absent, or out-dated

3.  get all absent files

    -   this will copy files from the storage directory to the project directory
