Initializing Devious sets up files to be copied to a storage directory where they can be retrieved later.

In R, this command may look like:

```{r}
dvs_init(storage_directory = "path/to/storage/directory", permissions = 777, group = "datascience")
```

-   `storage_directory` is a character of the relative or absolute path to the desired storage directory. If this directory doesn't exist, it creates it.

-   `permissions` is the octal value of the desired linux file permissions to set for retrieved files. This argument is option and is 777 by default.

-   `group` is the name of the linux group to set for retrieved files. This argument is optional and is unchanged by default.

Implementation Details:

-   you may only initialize Devious if your working directory is in a current git repository. The assumption is that versioning files with this tool is only useful in the context of Git, so this requirement prevents accidental initialization.

-   `storage_directory` must be a path to a directory, not a file. Devious doesn't assume the user meant to indicate the directory of the file to prevent accidental initialization.

-   to get the most out of Devious, `storage_directory` should be an accessible location to other collaborators who will retrieve files added by Devious.

-   Devious will notify the user if the storage directory already exists or is created at initialization

-   Devious will notify the user if the directory is not empty to prevent unexpected behavior

-   At initialization, Devious will check that the inputted group name is valid and that `permissions` can be converted to u32

-   Because the function of Devious is to prevent sensitive or large files from being tracked by Git, Devious automatically generates a `.gitignore` with entries for each file added to it. The `.gitignore` is located in the immediate directory of a given file added to Devious. If a `.gitignore` already exists in this directory, it keeps it and appends the entries of added files.

-   To keep track of initialization information (`storage_directory`, `permissions`, etc), Devious generates a `dvs.yaml` file in the project directory. When performing subsequent commands, Devious refers to the information in this file.
