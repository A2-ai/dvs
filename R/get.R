#' get or update files if they are in shared storage to add to the local repo
#'
#' @details retrieves files previously added with [dvs_add] to the storage
#' directory (initialized by [dvs_init]).
#' If a file is explicitly inputted without a corresponding dvs metadata file i.e.
#' hasn't been added yet with [dvs_add], the command returns an error.
#'
#' For any other error retrieving a particular file, the function itself will
#' indicate the error type and message in the data frame output; the function
#' itself will not return an error.
#'
#' @param files file paths or glob patterns to get from the storage directory
#' @param split_output when split_output is true, a list of two data frames -
#' `successes` and `failures` - is returned.
#' Rows in `successes` are files successfully retrieved, and rows in `failures`
#' are inputs that returned errors.
#' When split_output is false, the output is a single data frame with all files
#' attempted to recopy to the project directory,
#' and whose success or failure is indicated as such in the outcome column.
